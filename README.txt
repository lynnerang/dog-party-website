## Lynne's Dog Party

<h4 align="center">A project for practicing HTML, CSS, and a touch of JS for Turing's Front-End Engineering course, Module 1.</h4>


## Motivation

Dog Party is a project I was assigned as a new student at Turing.  We were given a static comp with limited styling details (e.g. a few color hex codes) to reproduce from scratch in code.  This was primarily working with HTML and CSS, and we also had a chance to experiment with form functionality using JavaScript and CSS media queries for making the design responsive.


## Built With

- HTML5
- CSS3
- A touch of JavaScript
